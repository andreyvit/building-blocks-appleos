# Building Blocks for Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS)

We believe that apps should be assembled from standardized building blocks like
houses, not designed from scratch like cathedrals.

Over time, we want to produce a collection of composable self-contained building
blocks that work well with a number of standardized internal (app & model)
architectures.

To install these building blocks, copy some into your project and check back
for updates regularly. Each component follows semantic versioning. This may seem
like too much work, but we believe the manual approach is appropriately hands-on.
